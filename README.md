#### Abstract

This paper presents a simple analysis of house music compositions. Using sound source separation techniques, the drums, bass, vocals, and other elements were isolated, and their sound pressure was calculated. The analysis revealed that drums and bass greatly impact the music structure, while other parts have less influence. Opportunities for improving the identification of intro and outro sections were identified.

#### Abstract

This paper describes a simple method for visualizing the musical structure of house music. A given audio signal is separated into drums, bass, vocals, and others, and then the sound pressure of each instrument part is calculated and visualized. Using those sound pressures, the audio signal is segmented into four sections: intro, drop, break, and outro. A preliminary analysis revealed that the drums and bass have a significant impact in delineating musical structure.
